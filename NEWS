1.3.4
=====
* Bugfix for memory leak in systemd observation

1.3.3
=====
* Two bugfixes for start up and error cases
* Improvement of systemd watchdog support

1.3.2
=====
* The handling of "restart_apps" has changed. Before this was a white list. 
  Only apps on the listed were allowed to restart the target. Now every app  
  is allowed to request a restart and only those on the list are blocked.

1.3.1
=====
* The NHM can now observe failing units via systemd. Furthermore, it catches the
* SIGTERM signal to properly shut down on systemd requests.   

1.2.1
=====
* Adaption of NHM to the new interface of the persistence client library.

1.2.0
=====
* The NHM can now observe the D-Bus. Observed busses can be configured
* as "monitored_dbus" in the conf file. Observation is done by calling
* the "GetId" method of the org.freedesktop.DBus default bus memeber, 
* every "ul_chk_interval".

1.1.0
=====
* The "shutdown flag" will now be stored via the GENIVI Persistency,
* instead of using the file "${datdir}/lib/shutdownflag"

1.0.0
=====
* First release of the NodeHealthMonitor (NHM)
* D-Bus interfaces: All currently specified dbus interfaces are provided
* Userland checks:  NHM can check if: files are present, processes are running
                    and if processes return valid (see node-health-monitor.conf)
