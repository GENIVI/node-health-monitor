  <!-- org.genivi.NodeHealthMonitor.Info:
       This is a DBUS interface that is used to interact between interested 
       parties and the Node Health Monitor.
  -->
  <interface name="org.genivi.NodeHealthMonitor.Info">
    <!-- RegisterAppStatus:
         @AppName:   Type='STRING'; Description='This is the unit name of the 
                     application that has failed'
         @AppStatus: Type='NhmAppStatus_e'; Description='This can be used to 
                     specify the status of the application that has failed. 
                     It will be based upon the enum NHM_ApplicationStatus_e'
         
         This method will be used by an NHM client to register that an 
         application has failed or recovered from a previous failure.
         The Node Health Monitor will maintain an internal list of the 
         applications that are currently in a failed state. 
         Additionally it will maintain a count of the currently failed 
         applications that can be used to trigger a system restart if the 
         value gets too high.
         
         The NHM will also call the NSM method SetAppHealthStatus which will 
         allow the NSM to disable any sessions that might have been enabled 
         by the failed application.

                   the failure count for. If this value is an empty string the 
                   NHM will return the failure statistics for the whole node'

                         number of failures that have occurred in the past X 
                         amount of lifecycles. The value of X will be 
                         configurable at build time'
         @TotalLifecycles: Type='UINT32'; Description='This value will be the 
                           number of lifecycles that are being used for the

         This method can be used by an NHM client to request a node restart if 
         a critical application can not be recovered. The Node Health Monitor 
         will have the possibility to internally evaluate whether the failed 
         application is important enough to warrant the restarting of the node.
         
         The NHM will then forward the request to the NSM who will evaluate 
         whether a restart is allowed at the current time.
